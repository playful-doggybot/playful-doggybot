## Repository Structure ##
* `legged_gym`: contains the isaacgym environment and config files.
    - `legged_gym`:
        - `legged_gym/legged_gym/scripts/`: training and visualization scripts. 
        - `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/go2/`: training config files.
        - `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/base/`: environment implementation.
    - `resources`: URDF files and robot models.
    - `logs`: where to store training logs and checkpoints.
* `rsl_rl`: contains the network module and algorithm implementation. You can copy this folder directly to your robot.
    - `rsl_rl/rsl_rl/algorithms/`: algorithm implementation.
    - `rsl_rl/rsl_rl/modules/`: network module implementation.
 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and create a new Python virtual env or conda environment with Python 3.8(recommended)
    - `conda create -n doggy python=3.8`
2. Install PyTorch 1.10 with cuda-11.3:
    - `pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.10.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html`
3. Install Isaac Gym
   - Download and install Isaac Gym Preview 4 (I didn't test the history version) from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym
   - `cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e .`
   - Try running an example `cd examples && python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py`
   - For troubleshooting check docs `isaacgym/docs/index.html`
4. Install rsl_rl (PPO implementation)
   - Using the command to direct to the root path of this repository
   - `cd rsl_rl && pip install -e .` 
5. Install legged_gym
   - `cd ../legged_gym && pip install -e .`


## Usage ##
***Always run your script in the root path of this legged_gym folder (which contains a `setup.py` file and `video.sh` file).***

1. To train a policy
    - `python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --headless --task go2_mix_cmd`
    
2. To visualize a checkpoint
    - `python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task go2_mix_cmd --load_run <path_to_your_ckpt>`
    - (Optional) Substitute `play.py` with `play_node.py`, which enables you to record all the reward and other kind of information during the visulization as a `.mcap` bag file. We recommand the tool [Foxglove Studio](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/introduction/) to replay the bag files for easily debugging and reward engineering.
